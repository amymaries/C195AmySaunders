## Additional Report
I actually included two additional reports because I couldn't make three reports look balanced on the Reports Screen.
My two additional reports include a customer's schedule and a user's schedule, so that app users can see at a glance
their own upcoming appointments or the receptionist could easily find a customer's schedule for a forgetful
customer who calls and wants to know when all of their upcoming appointments are.
